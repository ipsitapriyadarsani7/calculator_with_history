Hello everyone,
 am going to explain my project. My project is a Python-based Calculator Program. But this is not a simple calculator. I have added some extra features to make it more useful.

Step 1: What the program does
The program allows the user to enter a full equation, like 5 + 10 or 8 * 4. The program solves it and shows the result. For example, if I type 5 + 10, the output will be 15.

Step 2: Storing in a file
One special feature is that every calculation is saved in a text file. So if I calculate 8 + 12 = 20, this will be stored inside a file called history.txt. Next time, if I do another calculation, it will also get added to this file.

Step 3: Extra features for the user
I gave the user some options in the program:

History → The user can see all past calculations stored in the file.

Clear → The user can delete the stored history if they don’t need it.

Exit → The user can stop the program whenever they want.

Step 4: How the program works inside
To make this possible, I used:

Input function → to take equations or commands from the user.

If-else conditions → to decide whether the user wants to calculate, see history, clear, or exit.

Loops (while loop) → so that the program keeps running again and again until the user exits.

File handling → to save the calculations in a text file and read them later.

Basic maths operators → addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Step 5: Why this project is useful
Normally, a calculator shows only the current calculation. But in this project, the user can also keep a record of all calculations and even clear them when needed. It is like a small personal calculator app with memory.

Step 6: Future improvements
Right now, it only supports simple equations like number + number. In the future, I can add:

More operations like modulus (%) and exponent (^).

Support for bigger equations with multiple numbers.

A better user interface instead of command line.

Conclusion
So in short, my project is an advanced calculator in Python. It can calculate, save results, show history, and clear history. I built this using basic Python concepts like loops, conditions, functions, and file handling.

Thank you.
